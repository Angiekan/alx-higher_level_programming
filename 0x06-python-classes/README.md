Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer
Private instance attribute: next_node:
property def next_node(self): to retrieve it
property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object
Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):
